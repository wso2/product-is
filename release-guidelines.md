## TODO's after performing the RC release (Vote period)

## How to perform Release Candidate (RC) releases in Jenkins?
* Release version should be the final GA release version
* Development version should be the same as earlier releases
* Custom SCM tag should include the relevant candidate version. E.g. rc1
* Make sure to un-tick the ‘close Nexus Staging Repository’ option
* If the vote passes for the candidate we can manually close and release the product in Nexus. Else we can drop the candidate.
* Follow the same procedure to publish release of RC on github as other releases.
* Make sure to rename the downloaded pack to rc before uploading to github. E.g. for RC1 release pack should be renamed to <product-name><version>-rc1.zip.
* Announce for a vote on the release candidate @architecture+dev.

## How to convert RC to GA release when vote passes?
* Login to nexus and go to staging repositories. https://maven.wso2.org/nexus/#stagingRepositories
* Make sure other unqualified candidates are dropped.
* Find the corresponding qualified RC release candidate. This should be in open state.
* Close it and release the product

* Sync product to atuwa > inform infra team.
* Add the features to feature-repo (P2-profile).
