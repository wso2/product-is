Create a tenant addition listener to create resident IDP for that tenant

Create a user operation event listener to clear caches when role names or claimURIs are updated (provisioning
role, subject claim, etc.)

Create identity.common bundle to read identity.yaml. Expose a OSGi service from it. Subscribe for it's service and
wait for it to be initialized. Get the configuration element corresponding to identity.provider and parse the
configurations.

Add methods in identity.common bundle to replace actual passwords by random passwords and vice verse to show
passwords in UI. Replacing of actual password by random ones are done at admin service level.
Discuss and finalize on file based IDPs and shared IDPs. Shared IDPs were removed at admin service level from sending
to UI.

If shared IDPs are not allowed to be added from UI validate it. E.g. if we are using IDP name prefix to identify
shared IDPs need to validate for it when adding IDPs via admin service call.
Create interceptor for service methods. Implement audit logging and validation using interceptors

Need to design and implement Home Realm Discovery (HRD) properly. Removed homeRealmId and federationHub from
IdentityProvider for the time being.

Create IdentityException in identity.common and extend IdentityProviderException from it

Create suitable local caches. Discuss further on distributed caching requirements and implementation.

Check what does CarbonUtils.checkSecurity() do in caches class.

Check why IdentityProviderUtil.removeRandomPasswords() was used in CacheBackedIdPMgtDAO

Removed alias for IdentityProvider because we don't need it

Removed primary from IdentityProvider because its not used anymore

Removed "enabled" from IdentityProvider. It must be mapped in a different level. It's not part of IDP model. Model
only has a proxy method isEnabled(). Removed isValid() since it doesn't look belong to model object after building it.

Removed blocking from ProvisioningConnectorConfig since it needs to come from SP association.
Need to create separate DTOs to transfer data from UI to backend. E.g. enabled, default, etc. Don't use model class
for these stuff. Model classes will only have the proxy methods to retrieve these info.

There are 4 kinds of data categories we need to consider in IDP.
 - IDP metadata
 - IDP data specific attribute data (which we can change/not meta)
 - Data that is specific to SP-IDP relationship. E.g. OIDC scopes to be sent to IDP side.
 - Data that can be specific to IDP but can be overridden at SP level. E.g. provisioning filter?

Inbound provisioning requests can be federated to user store or IDP. Can't do either one. Always does both. Need to
fix it.

Similarly need to have IS proxying jit requests to IDP. This is a IDP-IDP relationship. E.g. Provision all the users
federated from Google to SF. Currently to do this we need enable jit in all the SPs we have.

Do we have SP-SP relationships - can SP grouping for SSO be considered a relationship? Or is it just a specific
feature we need to provider. It may be pointless to provide generic relationship feature just to solve on requirement.
Do we need SP-userstore relationship for jit provisioning?
