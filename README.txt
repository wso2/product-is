WSO2 Identity Server ${product.version}
==========================

Welcome to the WSO2 Identity Server ${product.version} release.

WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity and Access Management solution federating and managing identities across
both enterprise and cloud service environments. It supports a wide array of authentication protocols such as
SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive. It supports role based authorization and
fine grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound provisioning is supported through SCIM.

WSO2 Identity Server is developed on top of the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon platform, an OSGi based framework that provides
seamless modularity to your SOA solution via componentization.


System Requirements
===================

1. Minimum memory - 2 GB

2. Processor - 2 Core/vCPU 1.1GHz or higher.

3. Java SE Development Kit 1.8

4. The Management Console requires full Javascript enablement of the Web browser.

5. To build WSO2 Identity Server from the Source distribution, it is also necessary that you have Maven 3 or later.

Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
----------------------------------------------------------

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration. 
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to 
secure them with default mode. 

1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool 
	script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure   (in UNIX)  

This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually 

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files,  that have been defined in
		 cipher-tool.properties, with alias token values.  
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class. 

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files 
			can be found at repository/conf/security directory. 

2. Start server by running wso2server script from bin directory

> wso2server.sh   (in UNIX)

By default mode, it would ask you to enter the master password 
(By default, master password is the password of carbon keystore and private key) 

3. Change any password by running ciphertool script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool -Dchange  (in UNIX)
