# Deployment Engine related configurations
deployment:
# Currently there can be two modes
#  1. Scheduled Mode - (enable below property to "scheduled") - where the task runs periodically and trigger deployment
#  2. Triggered Mode - (enable below property to "triggered") - the deployment has to be triggered externally,
#   eg : in a worker node we don't need the task to run, but rather when we receive a
#        cluster msg,  the deployment has to be triggered manually
 mode: scheduled
