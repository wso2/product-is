WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity and Access Management solution federating and managing identities across 
both enterprise and cloud service environments. It supports a wide array of authentication 
protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive. 
It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound provisioning is 
supported through SCIM.

This is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon framework. All the major features have been developed as pluggable Carbon components.

System Requirements
===================

1. Minimum memory - 2 GB

2. Processor - 2 Core/vCPU 1.1GHz or higher

3. Java SE Development Kit 1.8

4. The Management Console requires full Javascript enablement of the Web browser.

5. To build WSO2 Identity Server from the Source distribution, it is also necessary that you have Maven 3 or later.

Building the distribution from source
=========================================

1. Install Java SE Development Kit 1.8
2. Install Apache Maven 3.x.x(https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#)
3. Get a clone from https://github.com/wso2/product-is.git or download the source 
4. Run the one of the below maven commands from product-is directory, 
    - `mvn clean install` (To build the binary and source distributions with the tests)
    - `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true` (To build the binary and source distribution, without running any of 
    the unit/integration tests)
5. You can find the binary distribution in product-is/modules/distribution/target directory.

    
Installation and Running
========================

1. Extract the downloaded/built binary distribution zip file
2. Run the wso2server.sh or wso2server.bat file in the /bin directory
3. Once the server starts, point your Web browser to https://localhost:9443/carbon/
4. User dashboard is available at https://localhost:9443/dashboard
5. For more information, see the Installation Guide

Secure sensitive information in carbon configuration files
----------------------------------------------------------

There are sensitive information such as passwords in the carbon configuration. 
You can secure them by using secure vault. Please go through following steps to 
secure them with default mode. 

1. Configure secure vault with default configurations by running ciphertool 
	script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool.sh -Dconfigure   (in UNIX)  

This script would do following configurations that you need to do by manually 

(i) Replaces sensitive elements in configuration files,  that have been defined in
		 cipher-tool.properties, with alias token values.  
(ii) Encrypts plain text password which is defined in cipher-text.properties file.
(iii) Updates secret-conf.properties file with default keystore and callback class. 

cipher-tool.properties, cipher-text.properties and secret-conf.properties files 
			can be found at repository/conf/security directory. 

2. Start server by running wso2server script from bin directory

> wso2server.sh   (in UNIX)

By default mode, it would ask you to enter the master password 
(By default, master password is the password of carbon keystore and private key) 

3. Change any password by running ciphertool script from bin directory.  

> ciphertool -Dchange  (in UNIX)
