<h1>Sign-In</h1>

<p>Figure 1: Sign-In Panel. </p>
If you are sign in on for the first time after the installation, use the
following credentials.<br/>
<br/>
Username: <strong>admin<br/>
</strong>Password: <strong>admin <br/>
</strong>

<p>You can sign in to a remote server by specifying its URL in the 'Server URL' field.
This field defaults to the value "https://localhost:9443/services/". </p>

<p>Enabling 'Remember Me' option makes it possible to sign-in to the management console in subsequent
    attempts without entering user credentials.</p>

<p>Please note that due to the inherited behaviour of default user store - which is embedded-ldap, 
user names are case insensitive in 3.2.0 based carbon products.</p>

<p>Please make sure you change the password for the admin account as the first
task after you log on. You can change the password from the User management
panel.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot delete the admin account.</p>

<p>If you are not the administrator, please contact your administrator to
create an account for you.</p>

<p>User accounts and user roles can be added and managed from the
<em><strong>User Management</strong></em> page. Click <strong>Help</strong>
on the <em><strong>User Management</strong></em> page for more information on
adding and managing users.</p>

<p>To access this page, in the navigator, under Configure, click <strong>Users
and Roles</strong>. </p>
