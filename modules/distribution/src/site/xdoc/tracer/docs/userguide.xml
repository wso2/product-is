    <h1>SOAP Monitor Tracer</h1>

    <p>The Tracer shows the SOAP messages, the respective SOAP message requests
        and responses - when the services are deployed on the server, and the invoked
        operations. By default, this feature is turned off. You have to turn it on to
        enable tracing. </p>

    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Turning on the Tracer feature will have a drag
        on the performance. This is because all the SOAP messages will always be
        completely built (i.e., deferred building will not be done) and stored in the
        database by WSO2 Data Services. Hence this option should be used with
        caution.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>In the navigator, under Monitor, click <strong>SOAP Message
            Tracer</strong>. The <em><strong>SOAP Message Tracer</strong></em> page
            appears.
        </li>
        <li>In the <strong>Status</strong> field, click <strong>On</strong>.
            The tracer will show the messages of the operations that were
            invoked.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>By using the SOAP tracer, you can see the SOAP messages with their
        time-stamps, service name, operation invoked and the number of requests to
        the server. The most recent SOAP messages are listed on the top. When a
        particular SOAP message is selected, its request and the response can be
        viewed. </p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: This tracer does not apply to operations invoked in
        the admin services, as they are filtered out.</p>
