        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>A successful project requires many people to play many roles.
            Some members write code or documentation, while others are valuable as
            testers, submitting patches and suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>The team is comprised of Members and Contributors. Members have
            direct access to the source of a project and actively evolve the
            code-base. Contributors improve the project through submission of
            patches and suggestions to the Members. The number of Contributors to
            the project is unbounded. Get involved today. All contributions to the
            project are greatly appreciated.
        </p>
