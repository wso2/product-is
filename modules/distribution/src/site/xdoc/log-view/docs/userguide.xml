<h1>Monitor Logs</h1>

<p>Logs can be displayed as System logs or application logs.System Logs shows the log events of the system logs depending on the product. Application logs filter logs by the application, it can be services or web applications. There are two ways to configure system logs, 1) through Memory Appender where logs will be taken from the memory, 2) BAMLogEventAppender where logs will be published to bam and log events will be taken from BAM storages. Only the latest daily logs messages will be displayed in the UI where the logs events can be filtered accordingly. Log events are archived daily per tenant per product per date and can be downloaded for further analysis.
</p>
<p>The log messages, displayed in this page are obtained from a memory appender. Hence, the severity(log level) of the
    displayed log messages are equal or higher than the threshold of the memory appender. For more information on
    appenders, loggers and their log levels, please visit <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">here</a>. </p>
