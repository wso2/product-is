<h2><a href="http://wso2.org/library/identity-server">About WSO2 Identity Server</a></h2>

<p>WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity Management and Entitlement Server which is based on
    identity and security standards and specifications.</p>

<p>WSO2 Identity Server is an open source Identity and Entitlement management server. It supports a wide array of authentication
protocols such as SAML 2.0 Web SSO, OpenID, OAuth 2.0/1.0a, OpenID Connect and WS-Federation Passive.
It supports role based authorization and fined grained authorization with XACML 2.0/3.0 while inbound/outbound provisioning is
supported through SCIM and SPML. It supports heterogeneous user stores including different LDAP implementations,
Microsoft Active Directory, Novell eDirectory and JDBC based user stores.
It is equipped with a set of identity provider features including OpenID, OAuth, SAML</p>

<p>WSO2 Identity Server is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.com/products/carbon">Carbon platform</a>
    (Middleware a' la carte), and is based on the OSGi framework to achieve the better modularity
    for
    your SOA architecture. This also contains a lots of new features and many other optional
    components
    to customize the behavior of the server. Further, if you do not want any of the built in
    features,
    you can uninstall those features without any trouble. In other words, this product can be
    customized
    to your SOA needs.</p>

<h2>About WSO2 Carbon </h2>

<p>WSO2 Carbon is a component based Enterprise SOA platform. The
    design of
    WSO2 Carbon focuses on separating the key functionality of the SOA
    platform
    into separate pluggable Carbon components that can be mixed and
    matched, like
    customizable building blocks. This allows you to add only the
    functionality
    you need to start up, and continue to add product capabilities
    as your
    requirements grow. This helps a business to quickly adapt to
    changes.</p>

<p>OSGi is used as the underlying core modularization technology
    to build the
    Carbon platform. The Carbon framework is shipped with Eclipse Equinox
    by
    default, but can be supported on Spring dm Server, Felix or Knoplerfish
    if
    required. The OSGi technology even allows you to write your business
    functionality as an OSGi component and deploy it in the existing Carbon
    platform. </p>

<p> For a quick start on using the WSO2 Carbon
    platform, the Carbon components are pre-assembled into the following
    products: </p>

    deploying them in a preferred architecture. Now WSO2 Carbon has the P2 based provisioning
    support as
    well. Please visit <a href="http://wso2.org/library">http://wso2.org/library</a> for more
    information. </p>

<p>The WSO2 Carbon platform gives maximum flexibility to adapt
    the middleware
    to your enterprise architecture, rather than adapt your architecture to
    the
    middleware. </p>
