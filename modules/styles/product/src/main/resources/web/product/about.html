<h2><a href="http://wso2.org/library/identity-server">About WSO2 Identity Server</a></h2>

<p>WSO2 Identity Server is an open-source solution that provides extensible, API driven and cloud-native IAM enabling
    developers to build and customize CIAM solutions.</p>

<p>WSO2 Identity Server provides capabilities such as identity federation & SSO, MFA and adaptive authentication, API
    (Swagger based REST APIs) and microservices security and privacy regulation compliance, which all combine to unify
    and manage identities in a CIAM solution.</p>

<p>The Identity Server also comes with a rich set of connectors enabling it to be a part of a larger community-based
    ecosystem and integrate with external parties. And the open-source nature of WSO2 Identity Server further ensures
    users enjoy community innovation while helping avoid vendor lock-in.</p>

<p>It draws on the strengths of the most widely used standards such as SAML, OIDC, OAuth while offering a
    platform-agnostic approach to implement a uniform security layer across existing assets across their digital
    business. Developers are able to use the source code on Github and get queries answered through stack overflow.
    Comprehensive documentation provides samples, quick start guides for easy implementation and to address complex IAM
    use cases.</p>
