This sample demonstrates how to use Security Token Service (STS) of Identity 
Server to obtain Security Tokens and to use them at a service such as WSO2 
Enterprise Service Bus' Echo service. 

This sample supports:
1. SAML2.0 / SAML 1.0
2. Bearer / HOK Subject Confirmation Methods
3. Authentication via UT and X.509 certificates (non-repudiation) 

These can be configured using the 'client.properties' file.

Note on Authentication via X.509 certificates
---------------------------------------------
To use X.509 certificates based authentication, keystores at sample and 
Identity Server should be configured.
